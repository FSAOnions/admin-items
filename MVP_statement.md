# MVP Statement

Our goal is to create an end to end solution for restaurant owners and a contactless/AMAZING food ordering experience for their customers as well. Ocra will allow customers be able to see the food of their choice in 3D through their camera with the help of AR technology. Now you don't have to worry about ordering too much or too little food because you can see it right on your table!

Waiters will be able to focus more on customer service and spend less time helping customers with menial tasks. Customers will also be able to order their food and pay for their bill without waiting for their waiter.

We will be using React-Native, Viro AR, Docker, Stripe, and Express.js.

## Proof of Concept

AR is a MUST for our app to be viable. The user has to be able to drag the food item onto the table surface and add items to their cart.

<!-- ## Notes
